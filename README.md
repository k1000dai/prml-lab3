# PRML Lab 3: Hidden Markov Models Project Activity Recognition 

This repository contains the code and analysis for Lab 3 of the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) course. The lab focuses on implementing and experimenting with **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**, particularly with **Gaussian emission probabilities**. The work is presented in a Jupyter notebook, combining code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:**  
  To understand and implement probabilistic models, specifically Markov chains and HMMs with Gaussian emissions, and to analyze their behavior on synthetic or real data.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Markov chains: transition and emission probabilities
  - Gaussian distributions: parameterization and sampling
  - Hidden Markov Models: training (e.g., EM/Baum-Welch), decoding (Viterbi), and evaluation
  - Visualization and interpretation of results

## Repository Structure

- `lab3.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter notebook containing all code, explanations, and results.
- `PattRecClasses` - Classes for HMMs and Gaussian distributions. 

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common scientific libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`

You can install the requirements using:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter
```

if you use uv, you can install the requirements with:

```bash
uv sync
```


### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd prml-lab3
   ```
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:

open the notebook with: vscode or something else that supports jupyter notebooks.

3. Follow the notebook cells sequentially. Each section contains code, explanations, and visualizations.
